= FMA Example

This source code can be seen as a small bootstrap for creating SNES games.


== Installation

To install all dependencies just type:

    npm i

You also have to check out the https://github.com/BenjaminSchulte/fma-snes[fma-snes] repository
to somewhere.

Afterwards you can compile the application using:

    node node_modules/fma-cli/index.js -I /path/to/fma-snes example.fma -o example.sfc

(You can compile the application directly using `fma-cli` if you installed the package)
